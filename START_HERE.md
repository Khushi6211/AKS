## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **STEP 1: Push Code to GitHub** (2 minutes)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd /home/user/webapp
./deploy.sh
```

Type `yes` when prompted.

**If you get an authentication error**, follow the instructions shown by the script. Two options:
- Use GitHub CLI (recommended)
- Use Personal Access Token

---

### **STEP 2: Wait for Render Auto-Deploy** (3-5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your `arun-karyana-backend` service
3. Watch the "Logs" tab
4. Wait for "Your service is live 🎉"

Render is connected to your GitHub, so it will automatically detect the push and start deploying!

---

### **STEP 3: Add Environment Variables to Render** (5 minutes)

**While Render is deploying**, add these environment variables:

1. Stay on Render dashboard
2. Click "Environment" (left sidebar)
3. Scroll to "Environment Variables"
4. Add these variables (you'll get the values from the services in next steps):

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=
SENTRY_DSN=
```

**Don't have these values yet?** That's fine! Continue to Step 4 to get them.

---

### **STEP 4: Set Up Free Services** (30 minutes)

Open the detailed guide:

```bash
# From your terminal or open in a text editor
cat PHASE1_SETUP_GUIDE.md
```

Or just follow these services in order:

1. **UptimeRobot** (10 min) - https://uptimerobot.com
   - Keeps backend awake 24/7
   - Critical! Do this first!

2. **Cloudinary** (5 min) - https://cloudinary.com
   - Image hosting for products
   - Copy: Cloud Name, API Key, API Secret

3. **SendGrid** (10 min) - https://sendgrid.com
   - Email notifications
   - Copy: API Key, verify sender email

4. **Sentry** (5 min) - https://sentry.io [OPTIONAL]
   - Error tracking
   - Copy: DSN

After getting these values, go back to Step 3 and add them to Render!

---

### **STEP 5: Deploy Frontend to Netlify** (2 minutes)

**Option A: Auto-Deploy (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Find your site: `arun-karyana-barara`
3. Go to: Site Settings → Build & Deploy
4. Click "Link to repository"
5. Select: `Khushi6211/AKS`
6. Branch: `main`
7. Save

Done! Netlify will now auto-deploy whenever you push to GitHub.

**Option B: Manual Deploy**

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Find your site
3. Go to "Deploys" tab
4. Drag and drop all files from your project

---

### **STEP 6: Test Everything!** (15 minutes)

2. Click "Add Product"
3. Drag an image or click to upload

- Check for typos in environment variables
- Make sure no extra spaces in values

### "Emails not sending"
- SendGrid API key not set or invalid
